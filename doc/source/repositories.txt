   There are two choices for RDO OpenStack repos.

      The CentOS RDO release repository doesnâ€™t change much over time and thus is intended for production environment.

      The Delorean repository picks up the source of upstream repositories each time there is a commit and builds a package from it.
      This repository has more bug fixes in timely manner, and have more recurring CI testing. As far as stability goes, the flow
      can be summarized like this:

      Delorean (current [1]) -> Delorean (current-passed-ci [2]) -> Stable (rpm repository [3])
      The delorean repositories (both current and current-passed-ci) share the same repository [4] for dependencies.

      	[1]: http://trunk.rdoproject.org/centos7/current/
      	[2]: http://trunk.rdoproject.org/centos7/current-passed-ci/
      	[3]: https://www.rdoproject.org/repos/rdo-release.rpm
      	[4]: http://trunk.rdoproject.org/centos7/delorean-deps.repo

      Periodically, the latest delorean repository is picked up and flows through a series of integration tests (CI) where OpenStack
      is configured and deployed in a series of ways to make sure that all the pieces of the puzzle work fine. If the set of
      packages passes these tests, they are then promoted to current-passed-ci.

      Additionally, Delorean is building directly from a more or less random git hash. Where as production is built more traditionally
      using a release tarball with some number of cherry-picked patches on top. Thus there is no direct relationship between what is
      in delorean current-passed-ci repo and what is the "production" repo. The delta is likely small when the production repo gets
      created at GA, but it is non-zero even then, and just gets larger as time goes on.
